"""Weighted least-squares gradient reconstruction for unstructured meshes.

This implements the standard CFD approach for computing gradients on irregular
meshes using weighted least-squares fitting.

The method solves for the gradient that best fits the function differences
to neighboring points/cells, weighted by inverse distance.

    Where weights w_i = 1/||x_i - x_0||^α (typically α=2).

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : Mesh
        Simplicial mesh
    point_values : torch.Tensor
        Values at vertices, shape (n_points,) or (n_points, ...)
    weight_power : float
        Exponent for inverse distance weighting (default: 2.0)
    min_neighbors : int
        Minimum neighbors required for gradient computation. Points with
        fewer neighbors get zero gradients. The default of 0 means all
        points are processed: ``lstsq`` naturally returns the minimum-norm
        solution for under-determined systems (fewer neighbors than spatial
        dims) and zero for isolated points with no neighbors.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Gradients at vertices, shape (n_points, n_spatial_dims) for scalars,
        or (n_points, n_spatial_dims, ...) for tensor fields

    Notes
    -----
    Algorithm:
        Solve weighted least-squares: (A^T W A) ∇φ = A^T W b
        where:
            A = [x₁-x₀, x₂-x₀, ...]^T  (n_neighbors × n_spatial_dims)
            b = [φ₁-φ₀, φ₂-φ₀, ...]^T  (n_neighbors,)
            W = diag([w₁, w₂, ...])     (n_neighbors × n_neighbors)

    Implementation:
        Fully vectorized using batched operations. Groups points by neighbor count
        and processes each group in parallel to handle ragged neighbor structure.
