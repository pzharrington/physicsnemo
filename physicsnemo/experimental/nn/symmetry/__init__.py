"""Symmetry-equivariant neural network layers.

This module provides layers for building SO(2) equivariant neural networks
for processing spherical harmonic representations.

Classes
-------
SO2Convolution
    SO(2) equivariant convolution layer using grid layout for efficient processing.
GateActivation
    Gated activation applying SiLU to l=0 and learned gating to l>0.

Functions
---------
make_grid_mask
    Create a boolean mask for valid (l, m) pairs in the grid layout.
